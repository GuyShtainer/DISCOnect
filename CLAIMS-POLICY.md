# CLAIMS-POLICY — what DISCOnect's own words may claim

Linted always: `tests/test_claims_policy.py` parses the fenced blocks below, so this file IS the lint's
source of truth.

**Positioning.** DISCOnect is training and wellness coaching software. It describes patterns in
the user's own history (their own days, their own baseline). It never diagnoses, treats or gives
medical advice, never compares a person with a population norm, and never names a condition.

**Disclaimer.** One sentence, shown in every coaching session, identical in `identity.py`,
`identity.ts` and `identity.rs` as `DISCLAIMER` (drift test); it is the first `allow` line below.

## Rules for authored copy
1. No medical verbs or nouns (lists below), case-insensitive, whole words; a trailing `*` stands for
   any word ending (`diagnos*` = diagnose, diagnosed, diagnosis).
2. No score names or marks: the watch makers' and training-software vendors' product names
   (Readiness, Recovery as a score name, Body Battery, TSS, CTL, ATL, TSB). The lowercase common
   word "recovery" in prose is fine; the capitalised score-name forms are not.
3. A string naming a vendor's own figure says ", vendor" after plain words (`Daily preparedness,
   vendor`, `Rest time, vendor`); it is not exempt from the score lists (the exemption was dropped 2026-10-06).
4. A negation may name a banned word only as an exact sentence in the `allow` block (the lint removes
   those sentences, then matches). Prefer rewording; allow only "do not diagnose" style lines.

Scope (authored strings only): this package's `identity.py` and `README.md`; beside this repository, the
desktop/phone shell's `src/*.ts`, `index.html` and `README.md`, the Rust core's identity module and the coach
system prompt (`coach/prompt.rs`).
**Not in scope**, on purpose: `contract.py`, `get_contract`, `mcp.json` and the Rust read paths carry
contract labels ("Body battery", "Training readiness"), a known debt (renaming breaks the parity
fixtures); test files and docs discuss these words.
